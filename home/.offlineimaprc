# Note: if you are using autorefresh and have more than one account,
# you must set this number to be >= to the number of accounts you have;
# since any given sync run never "finishes" due to a timer, you will never

########## Advanced settings

# You can have offlineimap continue running indefinitely, automatically
# syncing your mail periodically.  If you want that, specify how
# frequently to do that (in minutes) here.  You can also specify
# fractional minutes (ie, 3.25).

autorefresh = 15

# OfflineImap can replace a number of full updates by quick
# synchronizations.  It only synchronizes a folder if 1) a Maildir
# folder has changed, or 2) if an IMAP folder has received new messages
# or had messages deleted, ie it does not update if only IMAP flags have
# changed.  Full updates need to fetch ALL flags for all messages, so
# this makes quite a performance difference (especially if syncing
# between two IMAP servers).
# Specify 0 for never, -1 for always (works even in non-autorefresh
# mode), or a positive integer <n> to do <n> quick updates before doing
# another full synchronization (requires autorefresh).  Updates are
# always performed after <autorefresh> minutes, be they quick or full.

# You can specify a pre and post sync hook to execute a external command.
# In this case a call to imapfilter to filter mail before the sync process
# starts and a custom shell script after the sync completes.
# The pre sync script has to complete before a sync to the account will
# start.

# You can also specify parameters to the commands
# presynchook = imapfilter -c someotherconfig.lua

# OfflineImap caches the state of the synchronisation to e.g. be able to
# determine if a mail has been deleted on one side or added on the
# other.

# In between synchronisations, OfflineIMAP can monitor mailboxes for new
# messages using the IDLE command. If you want to enable this, specify here
# the folders you wish to monitor. Note that the IMAP protocol requires a
# separate connection for each folder monitored in this way, so setting
# this option will force settings for:
#     maxconnections - to be at least the number of folders you give
#     holdconnectionopen - to be true
#     keepalive - to be 29 minutes unless you specify otherwise
#
# This feature isn't complete and may well have problems. See the manual
# for more details.

# This option should return a Python list. For example

# Normally, OfflineIMAP will expunge deleted messages from the server.
# You can disable that if you wish.  This means that OfflineIMAP will
# mark them deleted on the server, but not actually delete them.
# You must use some other IMAP client to delete them if you use this
# setting; otherwise, the messgaes will just pile up there forever.
# Therefore, this setting is definitely NOT recommended.
