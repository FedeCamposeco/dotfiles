# Personal Configuration and Useful Tools

There are some subtrees to manage external repositories (e.g., st and zim).
Remember to update changes in upstream regulary using
```
git subtree pull --prefix <> master --squash
```

Setup (assuming ubuntu-based distro):
```bash
sudo apt install git
git clone <repo> ~/dotfiles
cd ~/dotfiles
stow <each folder>
```
profit!
